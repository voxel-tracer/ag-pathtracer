This path tracer is based on the Utrecht University [Advanced Graphics course](https://www.cs.uu.nl/docs/vakken/magr/2021-2022/).

The code is built on top of the course's generic [C/C++/OpenCL framework](https://github.com/jbikker/advgrtmpl8).

My intent is to follow the course assignments as closely as possible then eventually extend the path tracer with more advanced features.

I highly recommend following the above course if you want to learn how to write your own path tracer.
